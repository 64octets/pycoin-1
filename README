Pycoin 0.1-ish 

Pycoin is a program to implement the bitcoin protocol in python3.

To find out what it does run "./pycoin", this will print out a list of messages
recieved from the bitcoin client at "64.22.103.150" (roughly speaking). More
exciting features (ooh, command line arguments, shiny!) will be added in
future releases/commits.

A version of python3 ipaddr is provided until it is widely availible in
distributions.
